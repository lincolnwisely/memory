# memory

This game uses the Unsplash API to populate images based on the search query. Users have the option of selecting a pre-defined query or choosing their own.

Future enhancements could include:
- A counter to keep track of clicks
- A timer
- Animations for show/hide
- Levels of difficulty (increase # of squares, limit time image is exposed, etc.)

Hope you enjoy.
